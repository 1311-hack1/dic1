## üîß Environment Variables You Need

In Netlify dashboard ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables:

```
ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME = com.yourcompany.yourapp
ANDROID_CERT_DIGEST = A1B2C3D4E5F6... (your app's SHA-256 cert hash)
NODE_ENV = production
NONCE_EXPIRY_MS = 300000
```

## üåê Testing Your Deployed Service

Once deployed, test with:
```bash
# Replace YOUR-SITE-NAME with your actual Netlify site name
curl -X POST https://YOUR-SITE-NAME.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/get-enroll-nonce

# Should return:
# {"success":true,"nonceId":"...","nonceBase64":"...","expiresAt":"..."}
```

## üì± Update Your Android App

In your Android app, change the base URL to your Netlify site:
```java
String baseUrl = "https://YOUR-SITE-NAME.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/";
String nonceUrl = baseUrl + "get-enroll-nonce";
String enrollUrl = baseUrl + "enroll";
```

That's it! Your Android DIC enrollment service will be live on Netlify with auto-scaling and global CDN.
